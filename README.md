# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection
Detecting fradulent credit card transaction among large dataset using different machine learning models
Steps includes:
1.analysing customer level data
2.performing EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis)
3.under sampling the value of legit transaction   to match shape with fraud transaction to form new dataset
4.spliting dataset into train and test data
5.applying different machine learning models to the new dataset(LogisticRegression,SVM,DecisionTree)
6.using esemble learning to provide summation of all three models
